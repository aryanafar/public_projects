# STEM_Ethics_Survey_analysis.ipynb
In a team of 10, in the role of Academics Director of an Associated Students of the University of California Senator's office, I collected about 100 UC Berkeley STEM students' survey responses to questions about their feelings towards Ethics curriculum. This python notebook contains my independently developed visual analysis of these survey responses. These visualizations led to the successful passing of an official student government resolution to instate more robust STEM Ethics curriculum across the UC.
