# STEM_Ethics_project
This Python-based project analyzed 100 UC Berkeley STEM student survey responses, manually collected by me and 5 others in the iconic walkway of Sproul Plaza in Berkeley. As the team lead and sole techincal contributer, I independently coded the analysis and visualizations, which led us to pass an official resolution to implement more robust STEM Ethics curriculum across all UCs.
