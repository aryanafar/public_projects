# NYC_taxi_project
This project, conducted in R, was concerned with the relationship between NYC yellow taxi drivers' velocities and their customers' respective tips. I collaborated with 2 others, working with my colleagues thoroughly on each aspect of our deliverables, and taking the lead on the code and the model interpretation report sections. We ask, can faster, more strategic driving yield better tips?
