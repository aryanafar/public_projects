# CA_wildfire_project
This is a Python-based Machine Learning project utilizing climate data and relevant land features to predict California wildfire severity. As a leading coding contributer in a group of 3, I implemented cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, model training and validation, and final model assessment.
