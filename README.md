# public_projects
This is a public collection of some of my shareable academic and professional Data Science projects; this includes Python notebooks leveraging Machine Learning methods and visualization techniques, SQL and NoSQL projects, R projects with an emphasis on statistics and causal inference, experiments, and research design projects. 

## CA_wildfire_project
This is a Python-based Machine Learning project utilizing climate data and relevant land features to predict California wildfire severity. As a leading coding contributer in a group of 3, I implemented cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, model training and validation, and final model assessment.

## Dementia_deep_learning_project
This is a Python-based project utilizing brain scan image data to classify the severity of Dementia with Deep Learning models. Achieving 99% test accuracy, we focused on leveraging various feature engineering methods and implementing CNN-based architectures, including transfer learning. As a leading coding contributer and the main manuscript writer in a group of 4, I implemented cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data anlaysis, class balancing, development of more than half of our 21 unique models, model training and validation, and final model assessment.

## Education_and_likability_experiment
This is an R-based project wherein I ran a set of two experiments, answering the question of whether higher education makes women more or less attractive. As the lead experiment designer, head analyst, and sole manuscript writer in a team of 4, I deployed a Tinder field experiment and Tinder simulation survey side by side to test evolutionary psychological theory on heterosexual mating patterns in the context of higher education. Through rovust design choices and the inclusion of critical covariates, I surpassed prior literature in terms of statistical power and unbiasedness. Our two experiments came to the consistent conclusion that higher education does indeed have a small positive significant effect on attractiveness.


## NoSQL_food_delivery_project
This is a Python and NoSQL-based data engineering project utilizing BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) line data. We engineered food delivery system for a fictional Bay Area food delivery company (called AGM). We leveraged NoSQL (Neo4J, Redis, MongoDB) to solve various business problems that AGM might run into using just relational databases. As a lead design thinker and coding developer in a group of 3, I developed and implemented 3 graph algorithms to optimize BART path efficiency using Neo4J. I also developed various business solutions that leveraged Redis and MongoDB for to integrate traffic data and customer analytics.

## NYC_taxi_project
This is an R-based observational study utilizing NYC yellow taxi records to answer the question of whether or not a driver's speediness affects passenger satisfaction, measured in tip percentage. As the primary technical contributer and project manager in a team of 3, I implemented a fixed-effects model to account for within-group impacts of source-destination location pairs.

## SQL_food_sales_analytics_projects
This is an individual SQL-based project involving food sales analytics from parsing JSON files. I created, lodaded, and staged tables, and validated, cleansed, and preliminarily analyzed the data. After this analysis, I answered the question of whether or not to withold customer data from 3rd party sales channels.

## STEM_Ethics_project
This Python-based project analyzed 100 UC Berkeley STEM student survey responses, manually collected by me and 5 others in the iconic walkway of Sproul Plaza in Berkeley. As the team lead and sole techincal contributer, I independently coded the analysis and visualizations, which led us to pass an official resolution to implement more robust STEM Ethics curriculum across all UCs.
