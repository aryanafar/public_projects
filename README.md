# public_projects
A public collection of some of my shareable academic and professional coding projects.

## CA_wildfire_project
A Python based project utilizing CA wildfire data. As a lead coding contributer to this project, along with 2 teammates, I implemented, tested, and assessed a Random Forest classification model that predicts wildfire severity.

## NYC_taxi_project
An R based project utilizing NYC yellow taxi records. My team of 3 asks the question: Can a driver's speed, specifically their strategic speediness, affect what percent a passenger tips? We implement a fixed effect, or within groups, model to account for fixed impacts between source-destination location pairs.

## NoSQL_food_delivery_project
A Python and NoSQL based project utilizing BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) line data and Neo4J. Our company of interest is a fictional Bay Area food delivery system (called AGM). We aim to leverage NoSQL to solve various business problems that this food delivery company might run into using just relational databases in their company-wide analytics. In a group of 3, we developed and implemented 3 graph algorithms to optimize BART path efficiency using Neo4J (Python, Jupyter, VM, AWS). We also present various business solutions that leverage Neo4J, Redis, and MongoDB.


## STEM_Ethics_project
A Python based project utilizing 100 UC Berkeley STEM student survey responses manually collected by myself and a team of 10 in the iconic walkway of Sproul. I independently coded the analysis and visualizations, which helped us pass an official resolution to implement more robust STEM Ethics curriculum across all UCs.
