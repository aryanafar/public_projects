# public_projects
This is a public collection of some of my shareable academic and professional Data Science projects; this includes Python notebooks leveraging Machine Learning methods and visualization techniques, SQL and NoSQL projects, R projects with an emphasis on statistics and causal inference, experiments, and research design projects. 

## CA_wildfire_project
This is a Python-based Machine Learning project utilizing climate data and relevant land features to predict California wildfire severity. As a leading coding contributer in a group of 3, I implemented cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, model training and validation, and final model assessment.

## NYC_taxi_project
This is an R-based observational study utilizing NYC yellow taxi records to answer the question of whether or not a driver's speediness affects passenger satisfaction, measured in tip percentage. As the primary technical contributer and project manager in a team of 3, I implemented a fixed-effects model to account for within-group impacts of source-destination location pairs.

## NoSQL_food_delivery_project
This is a Python and NoSQL-based data engineering project utilizing BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) line data. We engineered food delivery system for a fictional Bay Area food delivery company (called AGM). We leveraged NoSQL (Neo4J, Redis, MongoDB) to solve various business problems that AGM might run into using just relational databases. As a lead design thinker and coding developer in a group of 3, I developed and implemented 3 graph algorithms to optimize BART path efficiency using Neo4J. I also developed various business solutions that leveraged Redis and MongoDB for to integrate traffic data and customer analytics.

## SQL_food_sales_analytics_projects
This is an individual SQL-based project involving food sales analytics from parsing JSON files. I created, lodaded, and staged tables, and validated, cleansed, and preliminarily analyzed the data. After this analysis, I answered the question of whether or not to withold customer data from 3rd party sales channels.

## STEM_Ethics_project
This Python-based analyzed 100 UC Berkeley STEM student survey responses, manually collected by me and 5 others in the iconic walkway of Sproul Plaza in Berkeley. As the team-lead and sole techincal contributer, I independently coded the analysis and visualizations, which led us to pass an official resolution to implement more robust STEM Ethics curriculum across all UCs.
