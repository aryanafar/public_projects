# public_projects
This is a public collection of some of my shareable academic and professional Data Science projects; this includes Python notebooks leveraging Machine Learning methods and visualization techniques, SQL and NoSQL projects, R projects with an emphasis on statistics, and research design. 

## CA_wildfire_project
A Python based project utilizing CA wildfire data. As a head coding contributer to this project, along with 2 teammates, I implemented, tested, and assessed a Random Forest classification model that predicts wildfire severity.

## NYC_taxi_project
An R based project utilizing NYC yellow taxi records. As the primary contributer in a team of 3, I posed the question: Can a driver's speed, specifically their strategic speediness, affect what percent a passenger tips? We implement a fixed effect, or within groups, model to account for fixed impacts between source-destination location pairs.

## NoSQL_food_delivery_project
A Python and NoSQL based group project utilizing BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) line data and Neo4J. Our company of interest is a fictional Bay Area food delivery system (called AGM). We aim to leverage NoSQL to solve various business problems that this food delivery company might run into using just relational databases in their company-wide analytics. In a group of 3, we developed and implemented 3 graph algorithms to optimize BART path efficiency using Neo4J (Python, Jupyter, VM, AWS). We also present various business solutions that leverage Neo4J, Redis, and MongoDB.

## SQL_food_sales_analytics_projects
An individual SQL-based project with analytics on food sales data parsed from a nested json. It involves the creating, loading, and staging of tables, as well as the validation, cleansing, and preliminary analytics of data. Our question of interest is whether or not to withold customer data from 3rd party sales channels.

## STEM_Ethics_project
A Python based project utilizing 100 UC Berkeley STEM student survey responses manually collected by myself and a team of 10 in the iconic walkway of Sproul Plaza in Berkeley. I independently coded the analysis and visualizations, which helped us pass an official resolution to implement more robust STEM Ethics curriculum across all UCs.
