# NLP_expert_RAG_system_project
This is an individual Python-based Generative AI project utilizing Cohere and Mistral LLMs in a LangChain environment. I created 4 unique RAG systems designed to answer questions about NLP, for both engineering and marketing audiences. Each RAG system differed from each other in their retriever chunking configurations, LLMs, embedding models, LLM hyperparameters, and prompts. I evaluated each of these RAG systems on a set of validation question and gold-standard answer pairs. I designed and rationalized the evaluation metrics of cosine similarity and BERTScore to compare the system outputs with the gold-standard answers. My work serves as a POC for implementing this system within a hypothetical tech company looking to launch GenAI products.

## NLP_expert_code.ipynb
This Python notebook contains all of the code for creating the vectorstore, instantiating the models, building the RAG systems, and evaluating the RAG systems.
