# NoSQL_food_delivery_project
This project was a collaboration with 2 peers (named in the presentation) involving the presentation of NoSQL databases Neo4J, Redis, and MongoDB as solutions to Bay Area food delivery business problems. For the business issue of dodging Bay Area traffic, we propose a BART-Truck hybrid delivery system, using Neo4J (for its ability to represent BART lines as graphs) and Redis (for its agility in updating data) to model BART paths and traffic patterns respectively into the delivery process. For the business issue of understanding customer purchasing habits, we propose MongoDB due to its nested structure and inherent ability to represent the same data from highly specific analytical POVs.

## Neo4j_graph_algorithms
This repository houses 3 python notebooks corresponding to 3 Neo4J graph algorithms that solve various BART related problems, such as the shortest path between two stations, the likely crowdedness of a station, and the effect of an obstruction at a particular station.

These are the presentation slides, outlining our proposed NoSQL Bay Area food delivery business solutions in depth.
