# NoSQL_food_delivery_project
This is a Python and NoSQL-based data engineering project utilizing BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) line data. We engineered food delivery system for a fictional Bay Area food delivery company (called AGM). We leveraged NoSQL (Neo4J, Redis, MongoDB) to solve various business problems that AGM might run into using just relational databases. As a lead design thinker and coding developer in a group of 3, I developed and implemented 3 graph algorithms to optimize BART path efficiency using Neo4J. I also developed various business solutions that leveraged Redis and MongoDB for to integrate traffic data and customer analytics.

## Neo4j_graph_algorithms
This repository houses 3 python notebooks corresponding to 3 Neo4J graph algorithms that solve various BART related problems, such as the shortest path between two stations, the likely crowdedness of a station, and the effect of an obstruction at a particular station.

These are the presentation slides, outlining our proposed NoSQL Bay Area food delivery business solutions in depth.
