# Education_and_likability_experiment
This is an R-based project wherein I ran a set of two experiments, answering the question of whether higher education makes women more or less attractive. As the lead experiment designer, head analyst, and sole manuscript writer in a team of 4, I deployed a Tinder field experiment and Tinder simulation survey side by side to test evolutionary psychological theory on heterosexual mating patterns in the context of higher education. Through rovust design choices and the inclusion of critical covariates, I surpassed prior literature in terms of statistical power and unbiasedness. Our two experiments came to the consistent conclusion that higher education does indeed have a small positive significant effect on attractiveness.
